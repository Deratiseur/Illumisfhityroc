My species lives a long way from here and I've moved away because I don't agree with its practices. We are memorivores, feeding on the memories of other living beings. But don't worry, I'm reading your mind but I'm not stealing anything from you. I reject with all my being the degrading and intrusive practices of my fellow creatures. I'd prefer to propose something more constructive for both of us: let me absorb some of your memories; not the important ones, just the insignificant ones like the people/animals you've seen out of the corner of your eye in your random wanderings, for example (1000 xp), and pay me 200 of your gold coins and I'll create for you with my psychic powers any object that suits you and that I know of.

In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.

There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

Whereas the saber was intended chiefly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, more highly curved, and tapered to an elongated, sharp point. This makes the weapon slightly slower but more effective and deadly in combat.

The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process that is more art form than anything else. This blade is an important facet of Kara-Turan culture. To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath. For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

The overall length of the bastard sword ranges between four feet and four feet ten inches.

In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.

Maces and flails are two examples of this, the war hammer is another. The horseman's war hammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer. It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip. (Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.) The shaft is about eighteen inches long.
